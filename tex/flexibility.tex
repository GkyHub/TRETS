\section{Design Flexibility}\label{sec:flexibility}

Though we have discussed the techniques used to achieve high speed and high energy efficiency design, most of the designs are focusing on a certain network. In this section, we discuss the methods used to adapt a neural network design to different network models. Two methods are used to achieve the hardware flexibility: HDL model based method and instruction based method.

\subsection{HDL Model Based Method}

HDL model based method is widely adopted in FPGA based accelerators~\cite{venieris2017fpgaconvnet, morcel2017minimalist, ma2017automatic, venieris2017latency, dicecco2016caffeinated, wang2016deepburning, sharma2016high, zhang2016caffeine}.

\subsection{Instruction Based Method}
