\section{Hardware Design}\label{sec:hardware}

In this section, we investigate the techniques in state-of-the-art FPGA based neural network accelerator design. We first focus on the techniques for improving the hardware performance and energy efficiency. As introduced in section~\ref{sec:introduction}, the system performance is mainly affected
