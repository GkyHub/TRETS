Recent researches on neural network have shown great improvement in computer vision over traditional algorithms based on handcrafted features and models. Neural network is now greatly adopted in regions like image, speech and video recognition. But the great computation and storage complexity of neural network based algorithms poses great difficulty on its application. CPU platforms are hard to offer enough computation capacity. While GPU platforms are highly parallelized, the energy efficieny is low. The high energy cost of GPU causes problems for a wide application of neural network. 

To address the above problems, various FPGA based hardware accelerators for neural networks have been proposed. Specialized hardware are designed to achieve high speed and low power neural network process. In this paper, we give an overview of previous work on neural network accelerators based on FPGA and summarize the main techniques used. Investigation from software to hardware, from circuit level to system level is carried out to complete analysis of FPGA based neural network accelerator design and serves as a guide to future work.
