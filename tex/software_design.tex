\section{Software Design}

The design of energy efficient and high performacne neural network accelerator involves software and hardware co-design. In this section, we investigate the software level optimization methods. Many researches on network model optimization have been proposed to reduce model size or reduce the number of bitwidth for the network. This helps reudce the computation and storage complexity.

\subsection{Data Quantization}
One of the most commonly used method is the quantization on the weights and neurons. 

\subsection{Network Pruning}
Network pruning reduces the number of connections between input and output neurons.
