\section{Introduction}

Recent research on Neural Network (NN) is showing great improvement over traditional algorithms in computer vision. Various network models, like convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), have been proposed for image, video, and speech process. CNN~\cite{} improves ImageNet~\cite{} classification accuracy from xxx\% to xxx\% and further helps improve object detection~\cite{} with its outstanding ability in feature extraction. Long short-term memory (LSTM)~\cite{}, a variety of RNN, reduces the word error rate of speech recognition from xxx\% to xxx\%. In general, NN features a high fitting ability to a wide range of pattern recognition problems. This makes NN a promising candidate to many artificial intelligence applications.

But the computation and storage complexity of NN models are high. The research on NN is also increasing the size of NN models. The largest neural network model for an $224\times224$ image classification requires upto 39 billion floating point operations and more than 500MB model parameters~\cite{}.
