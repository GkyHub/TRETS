\section{Introduction}

Recent research on Neural Network (NN) is showing great improvement over traditional algorithms in computer vision. Various network models, like convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), have been proposed for image, video, and speech process. CNN~\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet} improves the top-5 image classification accuracy on ImageNet~\cite{ILSVRC15} dataset from 73.8\% to 84.7\% and further helps improve object detection~\cite{girshick2014rich} with its outstanding ability in feature extraction. RNN~\cite{hannun2014deep} achieves state-of-the-art word error rate on speech recognition. In general, NN features a high fitting ability to a wide range of pattern recognition problems. This makes NN a promising candidate to many artificial intelligence applications.

But the computation and storage complexity of NN models are high. The research on NN is also increasing the size of NN models. The largest neural network model for an $224\times224$ image classification requires upto 39 billion floating point operations (FLOP) and more than 500MB model parameters~\cite{simonyan2014very}. As the computation complexity is propotional to the input image size, processing images with higher resolutions may need more than 100 billion operations.

Thus traditional hardware platforms are not suitable for neural network process. A common CPU can perform 10-100G FLOP per second. which is too
